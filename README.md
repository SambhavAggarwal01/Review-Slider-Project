# Review-Slider-Project
A Vanilla JavaScript Application for a Review Slider 

The Application Loads a Few Reviews of People

The Application has Previous &amp; Next Buttons to Travel through the Review Slider. The application is a carousel type where whenever the user clicks the next or previous button, the application shows the next or previos person's review.

On reaching the end of the slider the next button will lead to the first review.
If the user clicks the previous button on the first review the application will lead the user to the last review.

In this Project the JavaScript Fuctionality is divided into various "Modules" for code maintainability, reusability & reducing redudancy of code. Making use of Modules makes the code efficient to use and debugging the code is easier.
